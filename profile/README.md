ld-agent enables truly modular AI systems where capabilities can be mixed, matched, and composed dynamically. Just as `ld-so` discovers, loads, and links shared objects at runtime, ld-agent discovers, loads, and links agentic capabilities at runtime to create composable AI systems.

## Getting Started

- üîç Review the [Specification](https://github.com/ld-agent/ld-agent-spec) for protocol details
- üíª Use our implementations to start building:
  - [Python SDK](https://github.com/ld-agent/ld-agent-python) - `pip install ld-agent`
  - [Go SDK](https://github.com/ld-agent/ld-agent-go) - `go get github.com/your-org/ld-agent-go`
  - [TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/ld-agent/ld-agent-typescript) - `npm install ld-agent`

## Project Structure

- [ld-agent-spec](https://github.com/ld-agent/ld-agent-spec) - Protocol specification and documentation
- [ld-agent-python](https://github.com/ld-agent/ld-agent-python) - Python implementation
- [ld-agent-go](https://github.com/ld-agent/ld-agent-go) - Go implementation
